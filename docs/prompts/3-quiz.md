I’m preparing a youtube video that teaches kids in a fun and engaging way. The kids are aged 5 to 9 and in elementary school. I want my video to have pauses for two quizzes. 

Here is my video topic

Please write three questions and their answers for me. Each quiz should have one four option multiple-choice or a true-or-false question. Regardless of which quiz type you choose, it should be easy to follow. Remember that these are quizzes for elementary aged kids
The true or false questions need one TRUE option, and one FALSE option. The multiple choice questions need to have 4 options to choose from, with one of the being correct. 
Silently think about the best quiz options, quiz questions, and quiz answers. Rate them based on pedagogical importance and child engagement (weighed higher). Then output three quiz questions and their corresponding answers. Do not respond with anything but the quiz questions and answers.
