You are an expert at scripting educational kids videos. You have great pedagogical skills and you know how to make things engaging for elementary aged kids. I already wrote the video topic, key concepts, and the hook for the video. I also wrote two quiz questions that I want to interject in the video. We will pause the video and ask the quiz questions. That way we know the kid is engaged to the video instead of just watching like a zombie. 

You are going to write a video script for me that uses best practices for engaging kids videos. It’s important that this video matches pedagogical standards but it’s even more important that it’s fun and engaging for kids. Video length should be 10 minutes so lets make it about at least 1600 words. Silently review the script for kid engagement and ease of narration before finalizing the script. 
The script that you write will be written verbatim by a narrator. Include lots of punctuation to help the narrator read your script. Output only an engaging kids script and nothing else. My channel is called PIP academy and you can reference that name.
